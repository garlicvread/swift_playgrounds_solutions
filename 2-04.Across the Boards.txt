/*
Challenge: Identify a repeating pattern and define a function.

In this challenge, there are lots of gems to collect—so many, in fact, that there are several ways to solve the puzzle.

Choose a path that repeats a pattern, and use that pattern in your function.

If your code doesn't work the first time, keep playing with it—practice makes perfect! (But as always, you can move on whenever you're ready.)
