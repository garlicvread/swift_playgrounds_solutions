/*
Goal: Decompose a solution across multiple functions.

As you've just learned, it can b very useful to define a funcion that accomplishes a small task,
then call that function within another function to accomplish an even bigger task.

This practice makes your code more readable, because you can name a function based on its purpose; for example, turnAround().
It also simplfies the process of writing code, because after you've written a function to perform a bigger task,
you no longer have to think about the individual commands.

1. Run the code to see what happens when solveRow() is called.
2. Tweak the code inside solveRow() so that it solves a bigger chunk of the puzzle.
3. Call solveRow() along with other commands to solve the puzzle.
