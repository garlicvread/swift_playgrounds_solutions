/*
Challenge: Decompose repeating patterns into functions and for loops.

You've learned about the basics of coding, and you've solved a lot of puzzles with your character.
Now that you know about commands, functions, and for loops, you're ready to combine your skills for this challenge!

There are three stairways in the puzzle world, and each shares the same set of tasks to perform.
Can you figure out the pattern for the tasks and write the code?
